In OOP, each object is an independent unit with a <b>unique identity</b>, just as objects in the real world are. An apple is an object; so is a mug. Each has its unique <b>identity</b>. It's possible to have two mugs that look identical, but they are still separate, unique objects. Objects also have <b>characteristics</b>, which are used to describe them. @For example, a car can be red or blue, a mug can be full or empty, and so on. These characteristics are also called <b>attributes</b>. An attribute describes the current state of an object. In the real world, each object behaves in its own way. The car moves, the phone rings, and so on.The same applies to objects:<b> behavior</b> is specific to the object's type.<br><br>In summary, in object oriented programming, each object has three dimensions: <b>identity, attributes, and behavior.</b> Attributes describe the object's current state, and what the object is capable of doing is demonstrated through the object's behavior.",
